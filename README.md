# todos

The classic todo app that everyone writes

## Setup

Clone the repository down and run `npm install` to get all the dependencies installed.

## Running

A simple `npm start` will start the server and start `webpack-dev-server` as well to build the assets.

## Development

The patterns in the project are fairly self explanatory, it uses React + Redux + Redux Saga to get the job done. The project also runs prettier so that code style can be enforced and ESLint for linting.
